## Concepts

### Concept 1: Quote-Led Editorial

**Approach:** Lead with the most emotionally resonant quote from the About page. Minimal layout, typography-focused.

**Content Strategy:** The quote "In my family, healing was never something you learned from a textbook..." creates immediate intrigue.

**Strengths:**
- Emotional hook that creates curiosity
- Clean, editorial aesthetic
- Lets Destiny's voice carry the message

**Tradeoffs:**
- No image/visual of Destiny
- Less informational for users who want credentials

---

### Concept 2: Split Layout with Image

**Approach:** Classic two-column layout with image placeholder on left, content on right. More informational with credentials preview.

**Content Strategy:** Story teaser + credential pills give users a quick overview before clicking through.

**Strengths:**
- Visual balance with image
- Shows credentials upfront
- Traditional layout users expect

**Tradeoffs:**
- Requires a good photo of Destiny
- More conventional, less distinctive

---

### Concept 3: Generational Timeline

**Approach:** Visualize the "third-generation healer" story as a horizontal timeline showing Grandmother → Mother → Destiny.

**Content Strategy:** Makes the heritage tangible and visual, creating a unique differentiator.

**Strengths:**
- Most distinctive and memorable
- Visual storytelling
- Highlights the unique value proposition

**Tradeoffs:**
- More complex to implement
- Takes more vertical space
