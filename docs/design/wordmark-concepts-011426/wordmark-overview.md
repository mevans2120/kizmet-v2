# Kizmet Wordmark Concepts

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Font:** Cormorant Garamond (serif)

## Design Challenge

Rebrand from "Kizmet Massage and Wellness" to either "Kizmet Massage" or "Kizmet Massage Studio". Create typography treatments that feel sophisticated, warm, and professional while maintaining the existing sage/cream brand palette.

## Concepts

### Concept 1: Botanical Leaf + "Kizmet Massage"

**Approach:** An organic split-leaf mark paired with elegant typography. "Kizmet" in medium weight, "Massage" in lighter sage green.

**Logo Element:** Stylized leaf with gradient opacity - represents natural healing and growth.

**Strengths:**
- Distinctive, memorable mark for social/favicon use
- Leaf ties directly to wellness/natural healing
- Clear visual hierarchy between brand name and service

**Tradeoffs:**
- Requires maintaining a logo asset
- May feel more "spa" than "therapeutic massage"

---

### Concept 2: Zen Stone + "Kizmet Massage"

**Approach:** Stacked massage stones in graduated opacity with "MASSAGE" in small caps beneath "Kizmet".

**Logo Element:** Four stacked ellipses representing balance and traditional massage therapy.

**Strengths:**
- Immediately recognizable in wellness industry
- Strong vertical hero treatment
- Badge-like lockup works in many contexts

**Tradeoffs:**
- More literal/expected imagery for massage
- Vertical stack needs horizontal adaptation for nav

---

### Concept 3: Wordmark Only — "Kizmet Massage Studio"

**Approach:** Pure typographic treatment with no logo. Vertical divider separates "Kizmet" from "MASSAGE STUDIO" in nav/footer.

**Logo Element:** None (typography only)

**Strengths:**
- Most sophisticated/editorial feel
- "Studio" elevates brand positioning
- Simplest implementation across all touchpoints
- Scales from favicon ("K") to billboard effortlessly

**Tradeoffs:**
- No distinctive visual mark for quick recognition
- Relies entirely on typography quality
